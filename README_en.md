## Purpose of the app

This app should help to find the next defibrillator in the vicinity. This to help a person in need or reanimation as quickly as possible.The data are completely open source and come from OpenStreetMap. With the help of the app, each person should be navigated to the next best defi via the navigation app of the respective cell phone.

The data are all based on OpenStreetMap, so everyone can help to improve the app. This goes directly in the app. A defibrillator can be reported via app and is then available to all.

The app is a project by [Defikarte.ch](https://www.defikarte.ch) and is intended to help capture and visualize defibrillators throughout Switzerland.

**The map is far from complete, the app and the map should help to improve this data base. **
